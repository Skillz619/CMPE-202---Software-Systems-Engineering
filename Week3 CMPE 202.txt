Example

Consider a basketball conference. Each conference has exactly 10 teams. 
Each team has 12 players. Each player has a specific height, speed, and accuracy. 
Players know which team they belong to. 
Some players are scholarship players.
Scholarship players need to record their current grade-point average. 
Players may be transferred between teams. 
Teams play basketball games against other teams in the conference. 

The result of each game is determined using a function based 
on the height, strength, speed, and accuracy of the players on each team. 
Design a system for simulating this basketball conference.
